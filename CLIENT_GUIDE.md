# RomaRentals Contract Generator - Client Guide

## What Is This?

This is a **web-based contract generator** that makes filling out your rental contracts super easy. Instead of manually editing a Word document or PDF, you just answer simple questions, and the system creates a perfect, professional contract for you.

## How Does It Work?

Think of it like filling out a form online, but instead of getting a receipt, you get a complete legal contract!

### The Process:

1. **Open the webpage** (just double-click `index.html`)
2. **Pick which contract** you want to create
3. **Answer questions** one at a time (like "What's the tenant's name?")
4. **Review your answers** to make sure everything is correct
5. **Generate the contract** - it creates a perfect PDF-style document
6. **Print or save** it as a PDF

## Why Is This Better Than Editing Documents Manually?

✅ **Faster** - No searching through the document for fields to change  
✅ **No mistakes** - You can't accidentally delete important legal text  
✅ **Consistent** - Every contract looks professional and identical  
✅ **Easy** - Just answer questions, no technical skills needed  
✅ **Review** - Check everything before generating  
✅ **Multiple contracts** - Can handle different types of contracts  

## What You Asked For vs. What You Got
