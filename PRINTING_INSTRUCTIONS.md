# How to Print Contracts Without Headers/Footers

When you print or save your contracts as PDF, you might see unwanted information at the top and bottom of each page like:
- File path (e.g., "file:///D:/Working/WWW/CCCC/index.html")

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Set as Default
Most browsers will remember your print settings, so you only need to turn off headers/footers once!

### Tip 2: Check Print Preview
Before saving, always check the print preview to make sure:
- ✅ No headers/footers visible
- ✅ All pages look correct
- ✅ No blank pages
- ✅ Text is not cut off

### Tip 3: Page Margins
If text is too close to the edges:
1. In print settings, look for "Margins"
2. Try "Default" or "Normal" margins
3. Avoid "None" or "Minimum" margins

### Tip 4: Paper Size
Make sure "Paper size" is set to:
- **Letter (8.5 x 11 inches)** for US
- **A4** for international

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still seeing headers/footers
**Solution:** Make sure you unchecked the option in the print dialog, not just in browser settings.

### Problem: Blank pages appearing
**Solution:** 
1. Check print preview
2. Make sure margins are set to "Default"
3. Try printing again

### Problem: Text cut off
**Solution:**
1. Increase margins slightly
2. Check that paper size is "Letter"
3. Make sure scale is set to 100%

### Problem: File path still showing
**Solution:**
1. The file path comes from browser headers
2. You MUST turn off "Headers and footers" in the print dialog
3. This cannot be controlled by the website itself

## Summary

**The key step:** Turn OFF "Headers and footers" in the print dialog!

This is a browser setting, not something the website can control. But once you turn it off, your browser will usually remember this preference for future prints.
